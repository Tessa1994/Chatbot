##Motion.ai

######Limitation

> Motion.ai only operates on either a multiple choice or bot statement basis. So while you can guide the conversation, you can’t set out specific questions it may get asked and provide specific responses.  This means while it’s good for scripted channels and conversations, it wouldn’t be very good for anything where a freer format of conversation is anticipated (like qualitative market research for example). Unfortunately, that makes it very difficult to consider when looking for the best chatbot development site.

Choose this one if want to build a simple bot; like providing an online ordering engine for a hospitality business, which has multiple but restricted choices and data capture.
